## Build & Deploy

This project requires **JDK 11** to build and run the application. It also requires **cf** CLI if you want to deploy to PCF. You can visit [Dev Enablement's OnBoarding](http://x.ford.com/dev-onboard) page for links to download these resources or sign-up for a free-trial PCF foundation.

>If your workstation is not already setup to develop with Java 11, then you can refer to [Java 11 Workstation Setup](https://github.ford.com/DevEnablement/pcfdev-guides/blob/master/migrations/Java-11.md#workstation-setup).


#### CLI

To build, run `./gradlew build`

To start and run the application, run `./gradlew bootRun`. Your local running app is served on *http://localhost:8080/...*. Press `^C` (control-C) to stop your app.

To deploy your built application:

```bash
# login into your PCF space
# cf login -a https://[foundation-api-host] ...

# generate manifest based on 'dev-edc1' settings
./gradlew -PcfManifestTarget=dev-edc1 cfManifest

# push generated manifest
cf push -f manifest-generated.yml
```

#### IDE

Your IDE version must support Java 11 &mdash; i.e. Eclipse (>= 2018-09), IntelliJ (>= 2018.2).

**Your must install and enable use of Lombok for your IDE.** Lombok setup instructions can be found [here](https://github.ford.com/DevEnablement/pcfdev-guides/blob/master/base-service/README.md#lombok).
